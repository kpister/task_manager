# Task Manager

clients.json contains a list of client objects. Each object has a hostname, username, password.

We can add additional properties in the future as needed.

queue.json contains a list of shell commands which should be executed. These are not buildable right now, but in the future they will be objects as well.

task\_manager.py is annotated well within itself.
